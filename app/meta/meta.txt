in #cat_rental_request#overlapping_rental_requests, apparently I'm supposed to use some kind of query syntax I don't yet know (.where (conditions in foreign syntax)).  Seems sql or advanced rails-related.

how can the cat_rental_request form (through a call in new, through the controller) access the names of all the DB's cats?  That's a separate model.  Does it matter?  It seems to.  So, how to access a different model's resources from a controller.

Cat.all.each in the form!
